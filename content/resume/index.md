# Experience

## United States Geological Survey (USGS)
### Hydrology Data Scientist (Team Leader, Full-Time)
*(May 2022 - Present)*

- Manages and delegates work for team members, ensuring that tasks related to team goals get done on time in an accurate and efficient manner.
- Develops single training image Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) designed to generate realistic realizations of hydro-geological conductivity from sparse data combined with hydrologist-informed hypotheses of conductivity distributions.
- Tunes previously mentioned GANs to ensure optimal model performance using Weights & Biases integration

## The Farmacy Proxies
### Project Lead Developer (Self-Employed)
*(Nov 2022 - Present)*

- Constructed a ngrok web server for Shopify Webhook management to construct an order management pipeline from Shopify into an AWS DynamoDB, storing customer and order information.
- Generated business-related insights from Shopify order information through ML training on data stored on AWS DynamoDB, including an order prediction algorithm based on previous proxy purchase patterns and industry release timing to be used for targeted coupon code marketing through the DiscordAPI which resulted in a 28% increase in proxy orders.

## United States Geological Survey (USGS)
### Hydrology Data Scientist (Student Trainee, Part-Time)
*(Jul 2019 - May 2022)*

- Constructed software used by dozens of hydrologists for distributed Tree Parzen Estimator hyperparameter optimization for MODFLOW-NWT model solver settings, resulting in months worth of saved computation time.
- Built on top of industry leading software (PEST) using TensorBoard to provide United States Hydrologists with live loss and metrics tracking for monitoring and managing their water model runs.
- Designed and configured a new GPU computation cluster using Lambda Stack and Docker containers.

## Paradigm

### Software Engineer Intern (Part-time)
*(Jun 2020 - Dec 2020)*

- Set up serverless environment in Azure Cloud and linked it to our product.
- Developed Azure functions that automatically processed extracted data into business related functions whenever new data was added to SQL storage.
- Transitioned an acquired company’s workflow to fit our technologies.
- Conducted code review of other developers work.
