# Experience

## United States Geological Survey (USGS)
### Software Engineer (Student Team Leader, Part-Time)
*(May 2019 - Present)*

- Manages and delegates work for team members, ensuring that tasks related to team goals get done on time in an accurate and efficient manner.
- Develops single training image Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) designed to generate realistic realizations of hydro-geological conductivity from sparse data combined with hydrologist-informed hypotheses of conductivity distributions. Tunes these GANs with Weights & Biases’ API for hyperparameter Bayesian optimization.
- Constructed software as described in NWTOPT publication that is used by dozens of hydrologists for distributed Tree Parzen Estimator hyperparameter optimization for MODFLOW-NWT model solver settings, resulting in an average of ∼80% run time reduction. This has saved the USGS months worth of computation server time.

## The Farmacy Proxies
### Project Lead Developer (Self-Employed)
*(Nov 2022 - Present)*

- Hosted a nginx server on a personal compute cluster for Shopify webhook management to construct an order management
pipeline from Shopify into an AWS, storing customer and order information in DynamoDB which then was to be
processed by other business-related subroutines.
- Generated business-related insights from Shopify order information through ML training on data stored on a AWS
DynamoDB, including an order prediction algorithm based on previous proxy purchase patterns and industry release
timing to be used for targeted coupon code marketing through the Discord API which resulted in a 28% increase in proxy
orders.

## Paradigm

### Software Engineer Intern (Part-time)
*(Jun 2020 - Dec 2020)*

- Set up serverless environment in Azure Cloud and linked it to our product.
- Developed Azure functions that automatically processed extracted data into business related functions whenever new data was added to SQL storage.
- Transitioned an acquired company’s workflow to fit our technologies.
- Conducted code review of other developers work.

# Projects

## Multi-Threaded Radix Sort
- Developed a multi-threaded radix sort algorithm, written in C, for my Operating Systems class. Sorting 10,000,000 4B keys with 96B records (1GB file) and writing those sorted records to a new file in 3.46s (on a M1 Mac).

## Mini-DBMS 
- Collaborated with teammates to develop a SQL Database Management System, written in C++, for my Database class.
